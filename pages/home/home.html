    <p>
      The NeuroXR Lab embraces advanced visual arts technology to develop
      innovative ways to assess and improve mental health through both research
      and development. Led by personnel from the IUPUI School of Informatics and
      the IU School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry, we conduct research
      aimed at increasing the options for clinicians and patients to address
      mental health concerns through advanced technology such as virtual reality
      or augmented reality. Our team and facilities are also designed to be a
      resource for investigators in Indiana and beyond who aim to develop new
      technology to improve physical or mental health as part of training,
      teaching, assessment, or therapy.

              <p>
                We investigate how novel virtual reality programs can shape
                thoughts and behavior, using VR to give users embodied
                experiences that are otherwise impossible to provide. With
                targeted interventions and assessments, our research focuses on
                disruptive behavior disorders, ADHD, substance use disorders,
                and alcohol use disorders, from childhood to adulthood.

                focus. We have the resources and expertise necessary to carry
                new projects from a basic idea to fully developed XR programs.

                The Indy NeuroXR Lab brings together faculty with psychiatric
                and informatics expertise to optimize XR research and
                development, as well as teams of students with cutting-edge
                knowledge. We have experience building novel XR programs from
                scratch and investigating how these programs impact the brain to
                improve mental health.
