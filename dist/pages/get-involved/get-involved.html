                As we continue to grow, the NeuroXR Lab is consistently seeking
                new relationships with students, faculty, and community members.
                There are multiple ways to get involved with the NeuroXR team.
                Students interested in joining the team can learn more about
                roles and inquire about current opportunities. We also seek new
                collaborations for individuals at IUPUI, IUSM, and beyond who
                seek to employ VR or AR in their work.

                  The NeuroXR Lab would not be successful without the
                  contributions of our student workers. Undergraduate and
                  graduate students have played a vital role in both the
                  research and developmental processes, from conceptualization
                  to the final product. This work provides hands-on experience
                  with state-of-the-art technology and software that is used in
                  leading tech companies, medical centers, and entertainment
                  studios. Availability of paid and unpaid positions varies.

                  The NeuroXR Lab wants to work with you! As VR and AR
                  technologies become more prominent for research, clinical,
                  educational, and commercial purposes, we aim to partner with
                  forward-thinking individuals who want to incorporate new XR
                  technology into their work. We welcome those at any stage of
                  the process, even if questions or ideas are all you have.
                  Connect with us, and we can discuss our capabilities and how
                  we can work together.
