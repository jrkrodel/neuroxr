        NeuroXR Collaborative embraces advanced visual arts technology to
        develop innovative ways to assess and improve mental health through both
        research and development. Led by personnel from the IUPUI School of
        Informatics and the IU School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry, we
        conduct research aimed at increasing the options for clinicians and
        patients to address mental health concerns through advanced technology
        such as virtual reality or augmented reality. Our team and facilities
        are also designed to be a resource for investigators in Indiana and
        beyond who aim to develop new technology to improve physical or mental
        health as part of training, teaching, assessment, or therapy.

            We investigate how novel virtual reality programs can shape thoughts
            and behavior, using VR to give users embodied experiences that are
            otherwise impossible to provide. With targeted interventions and
            assessments, our research focuses on disruptive behavior disorders,
            ADHD, substance use disorders, and alcohol use disorders, from
            childhood to adulthood.
