    <!-- Intro Paragraph -->

      The NeuroXR Lab uses extended reality to investigate aspects of mental
      health throughout the lifespan, including the mechanisms of psychiatric
      disorders and the impact of novel interventions we have developed. These
      projects are initiated by the NeuroXR team and use XR technologies along
      with advanced neuroimaging methods, electronic surveys, biometric
      recordings, and more to measure cognition, behavior, and brain function.
      Our cutting-edge research with VR takes advantage of the realistic
      environments that users can experience, with the ability to closely
      control what they see and hear. In this manner, we can assess and modify
      thoughts and behaviors in ways that are impossible in real-world settings,
      providing an optimal way to stay on the forefront of mental health
      research and treatment. Our research has been funded by both local and
      national organizations, including Indiana University and the National
      Institute of Health.
