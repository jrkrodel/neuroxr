        <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
        <p class="rvt-p-top-md rvt-p-bottom-md">
          The NeuroXR Lab uses extended reality to investigate aspects of mental health throughout the lifespan, including the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and the impact of novel interventions we have developed. These projects are initiated by the NeuroXR team and use XR technologies along with advanced neuroimaging methods, electronic surveys, biometric recordings, and more to measure cognition, behavior, and brain function. Our cutting-edge research with VR takes advantage of the realistic environments that users can experience, with the ability to closely control what they see and hear. In this manner, we can assess and modify thoughts and behaviors in ways that are impossible in real-world settings, providing an optimal way to stay on the forefront of mental health research and treatment. Our research has been funded by both local and national organizations, including Indiana University and the National Institute of Health. </p>
