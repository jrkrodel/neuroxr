        NeuroXR Collaborative uses extended reality to investigate aspects of
        mental health throughout the lifespan, including the mechanisms of
        psychiatric disorders and the impact of novel interventions we have
        developed. These projects are initiated by the NeuroXR team and use XR
        technologies along with advanced neuroimaging methods, electronic
        surveys, biometric recordings, and more to measure cognition, behavior,
        and brain function. Our cutting-edge research with VR takes advantage of
        the realistic environments that users can experience, with the ability
        to closely control what they see and hear. In this manner, we can assess
        and modify thoughts and behaviors in ways that are impossible in
        real-world settings, providing an optimal way to stay on the forefront
        of mental health research and treatment. Our research has been funded by
        both local and national organizations, including Indiana University and
        the National Institute of Health.
