# NeuroXR Collaborative

## Description

NeuroXR Collaborative utilizes virtual reality technology and psychiatric research to create innovative methods of assessing and improving mental health. This collaboration is led by personnel from the IUPUI School of Informatics and Computing - Media Arts and Science and the IU School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry.

As students of N420 Multimedia Project Development, we have been tasked with creating an IU based website to showcase the research and development of NeuroXR Collaborativeâ€™s work and encourage students and collaborators to get involved. Throughout the design and development process, we have been collaborating alongside Dr. Hummer, the lead psychiatrist of NeuroXR, and Zeb Wood, our N420 professor and a designer of NeuroXR.

Note for any future teams/development. All JavaScript files are bundled, to make any further additions or changes, edit the files in app.js or model.js, and then run the build command found in package.json.
